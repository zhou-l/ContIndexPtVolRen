# Continuous Indexed Points for Multivariate Volume Visualization
The project includes the visualization tool for exporing processed multivariate volumes, and the Matlab code that preprocesses the multivariate volumes and indexed points.

More information can be found in the paper "Continuous Indexed Points for Multivariate Volume Visualization" by Liang Zhou, Xinyi Gou, and Daniel Weiskopf. (The CVM journal).

# Installations
To install the visualization tool, unzip "bin.zip" and "opencv_world450.zip" in the vistool directory. 

Place the unzipped "opencv_world450.dll" to the unzipped bin directory. 

[Binary files are placed separately due to the file size limit of github.]

# How to Run?

Run the visualization tool using "QImprovedContPlots.exe" in the unzipped bin directory.

# Documentation
Find the documentation "Instruction.pdf" in the vistool directory.
